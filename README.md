# gamos-madScientistsDiary-

Hi. We are GAMOS (Systems Analysis, Modeling and Optimization Group of CAA / UFPE) !!!

Soon I hope we will be many groups :)

I created this journal to publicize the work being carried out by scientists around the world.

I still need to check annoying questions like "which license should I use??? ".

But soon we will be getting started.

Don't waste time, be part of it.
