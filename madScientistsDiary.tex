\huge{mad Scientists Diary} \\

\large{Calling !!!! gamos-madScientistsDiary-} \\

Hi. We are GAMOS (Systems Analysis, Modeling and Optimization Group of CAA / UFPE) !!! \\

Soon I hope we will be many groups :) \\

I created this journal to publicize the work being carried out by scientists around the world. \\

I still need to check annoying questions like "which license should I use??? ". \\

But soon we will be getting started. \\

Don't waste time, be part of it. \\

https://github.com/tbfraga/gamos-madScientistsDiary- \\

I used the word 'mad', because nowadays it is crazy to keep scientific works being developed in secrecy. \\

And on the other hand, nobody wants to divulge anything... so, for crazy scientists who can see things way ahead of the moment we live in :))) \\

To join us please contact: tatiana.balbi@ufpe.br
